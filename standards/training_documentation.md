# Overview
Training documentation is created iteratively to support incremental versions of AIDE.

# Standards
Training documentation must meet the following standards:

- Group artifacts by version.
- Use the template found [here](../templates/training_documention_template.md).
- A Training Document can include multiple user actions. i.e Clinical Review
    - Split complicated procedures into smaller sub-sections
- Step-by-Step Guides should be concise and easy to follow.
- Use common language throughout the training resources.
    - If a glossary is needed then create one.
- Use the same phrasing.
    - If you use the phrase **“from the Tools menu, select Options,”** the next time you direct the user to choose an option from a menu you should use the same phrasing, e.g. **“from the Edit menu, select Paste Special.”**
- Use GIFs (Preferred) and screenshots to help visualisation. Most people prefer information in a visual format and GIFs and screenshots help display the end to end journey.
    - GIFs and screenshots should be saved in the static folder
    - Screenshots should be annotated
        - Be careful over using screenshots as they can clutter the training materials.
